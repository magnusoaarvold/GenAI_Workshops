# Accenture Generative AI Workshop Repository

This repository contains a series of workshops that you can run using Google Colab. 

## Running the Workshops

The workshops can be accessed and run directly on Google Colab, but you need keys to access the APIs. These can be free or paid.
- Huggingface provides smaller models for free. Just requires signup for use.
- OpenAI requires billing set up for API usage. Costs 0.002 USD per 1000 token for GPT-3.5-turbo.
- GCP requires a billng account in Google Cloud Platform, a service account and Vertex AI enabled. Approximately same price as OpenAI for usage.

Google colab can be opened by adding "tocolab" after github in the URL like so:
* https://githubtocolab.com/acntech/GenAI_Workshops/intro_prompt_design.ipynb
